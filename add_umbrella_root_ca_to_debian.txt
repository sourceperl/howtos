Why ?

to fix python pip SSL error on debian WSL with Cisco Umbrella

How ?

Add Umbrella root CA to list of debian trusted certificates:

- search "Cisco Umbrella Root CA" into chrome browser certificates,
export it as X509 base64 encode (Cisco_Umbrella_Root_CA.cer)

- copy it to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/

- change extension from *.cer to *.crt

- ensure file is own by root/root and set file mode like this :

    sudo chmod 644 /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/Cisco_Umbrella_Root_CA.crt

- refresh /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt with new certificate :

    sudo dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates

- now pip can use Umbrella proxy, test it :

    # must return "Verify return code: 0 (ok)"
    openssl s_client -connect files.pythonhosted.org:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs/
